The following are features of the master DuoTone syntax theme.

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

More optimizations to come. See the growing list of [all languages](/styles/languages).


## Variations

Here a list for all [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:
